Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (1.5.2), increment the:

   1.) MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
   5.) MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
   2 ) PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
